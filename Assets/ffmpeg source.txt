Zeranoe builds from Feb 2016 no longer work correctly in windows XP, without patching.
See:  https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3572
Alternative source is from MPlayer for Win32.
Select latest FFMpeg/git folder and download the x86 version.  (not x86_64)
url:   https://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayer-win32/files/FFmpeg/
ie: git-N-82759-g1f5630a 	2016-12-04
download:  FFmpeg-x86-N-82759-g1f5630a.7z

Advantages are:  Compatible XP through to Windows 10.
Slightly smaller exe than Zeranoe's build.

Until such time as we can compile FFMpeg.exe for ourselves, with only video Codec's,
as we only use FFMpeg for frame capture.
